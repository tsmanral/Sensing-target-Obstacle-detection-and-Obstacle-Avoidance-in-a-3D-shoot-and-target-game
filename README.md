 
## Sensing target-Obstacle detection-and-Obstacle Avoidance in a 3D shoot-and-target game

### Abstract:
This project will be based on a game in a 3d space(cube or Polytopes) where a player has to send the ball to the target by detecting the obstacles which can have few planes or curves at any position in that space. The goal of this project is to train the player to self-learn the curvature, obstacle detection, and avoidance when placed at any point in minimal steps. The AI will learn the line of the shot to reach the goal with minimum chances. The surface can have certain friction which will allow the collision and thus the ball to deflect. This will work as an illumination problem.

### Milestones to cover:

#### Milestone 1:
Set up the environment: Requirements: Unity, mlagents, python, VSCode, tensorflow, CUDA

#### Milestone 2:
Create a GUI for the game using Unity

#### Milestone 3:
Program the game mechanics using Unity and VSCode. These will include planes inside the cube (These planes will be static as well as moving) and the action on the ball (How should we shoot the ball i.e. line of shot). I'll probably use the timer on the ball, for e.g., after 3-5 seconds the action on the ball will start from the upcoming collision with any plane.

#### Milestone 4:
Program the model using tensorflow framework in python with reinforcement model using mlagents package in Unity.
